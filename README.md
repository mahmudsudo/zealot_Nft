Root Directory
The root directory  contains the following:

src/: Contains the Rust source code for the program.
lib.rs/: Main entry point of the Anchor program.
errors.rs/: Custom error definitions.
state/: Defines program state and accounts.
instructions/: Contains instruction handlers.
program.rs/: Program entry point and IDL generation.
other modules/: Additional modules for program logic.
tests/: Contains unit and integration tests.
target/: Generated build artifacts.
Anchor.toml/: Anchor project configuration file.
Cargo.toml/: Rust project configuration file.
src/lib.rs
The lib.rs file is the main entry point for the Anchor program. It typically imports necessary modules, defines program-level constants, and provides the program! macro with program ID and IDL generation information.

src/error.rs
The error.rs file defines custom error types for the program. This helps in handling errors gracefully and providing informative error messages.

state/
The state folder defines the program's state and accounts. It uses Anchor's account macros to define account layouts and constraints.

src/instructions
The instructions directory contains instruction handler functions. Each instruction is typically defined in a separate module for better organization.

src/program.rs
The program.rs file contains the program's entry point and IDL generation logic. It uses Anchor's program! macro to define the program's ID and generate the IDL file.

tests
The tests directory contains unit and integration tests for the program. Anchor provides testing utilities for interacting with the program and asserting program behavior.

Anchor.toml
The Anchor.toml file contains configuration options for the Anchor project, such as program ID, RPC URL, and wallet address.

Cargo.toml
The Cargo.toml file is the standard Rust project configuration file, specifying dependencies and other build-related informatio
